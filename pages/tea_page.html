                    <p class="post-summary">This is just random tea documentation notes. I'm really into tea so all I do is write about the tea I've had that day and figure out which is the best way to brew it. I also review the tea sometimes (on a scale from 0-10), and determine if certain brewing times are "better" than others. Sometimes, I might neglect to care, and others I won't, it's entirely dependent on how I feel. And as something extra, I will include links to the websites that host the teas I have.</p>

                    <p class="post-summary">Tried the Jasmine Tea at some Thai fusion joint. I wasn't familiar with the brand but seeing their website, they seem to know what they're doing. Personally, I think there was something missing, but then again I have a strong preference for green tea w/ roasted brown rices, so that might just be that. Again, I just let it steep as I usually do, so I didn't know if there was a specific timer for it.</p>
