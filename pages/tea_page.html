                    <p class="post-summary">This is just random tea documentation notes. I'm really into tea so all I do is write about the tea I've had that day and figure out which is the best way to brew it. I also review the tea sometimes (on a scale from 0-10), and determine if certain brewing times are "better" than others.</p>

                    <p class="post-summary">Tried the Jasmine Tea at some Thai fusion joint. I wasn't familiar with the brand but seeing their website, they seem to know what they're doing. Personally, I think there was something missing, but then again I have a strong preference for green tea w/ roasted brown rices, so that might just be that. Again, I just let it steep as I usually do, so I didn't know if there was a specific timer for it.</p>

                    <p class="post-summary">Had the PoW again. And like the last blog about the POW, I decided to steep it in for 3 minutes. It didn't have much flavor, so I only drank it for a few sips and put the bag back in. Tasted much better after I left it in there for a long time.</p>

                    <p class="post-summary">Had my favorite type of tea today. Nice mellow taste and I enjoy it overall. But since I was so busy coding this site, I completely forgot I had it... so it's now cold as I type this. But before it was cold, I made sure to enjoy more than a few sips. And like usual, I just kept the bag in there like they usually do at Japanese restuarants.</p>

                    <p class="post-summary">Going to a Korean BBQ restaraunt, I had high expectations for tea, but I was semi-disappointed when I got generic green tea... the ones you see at hotels. I don't necessarily hate Lipton, but it's not my, cup of tea. Since I don't usually have Lipton, I don't really care to footnote the steeping time.</p>

                    <p class="post-summary">I have a serious bias towards oolong tea, but honestly the cheap kind isn't all that good. I've been having this Wegman's branded Oolong for a bit and honestly it's not bad bad, but not the best oolong I've had. I kept it steeped in, but since I ran out of this specific tea, I will have to hold on steeping it for however long I choose to steep it for. Otherwise, I'm not sure if I'll be able to have tea tomorrow since school is resuming, but I will try and have black tea for my morning drink during work.</p>

                    <p class="post-summary">As promised the day before, I'd make sure to have a cup of tea, or something in that nature. I had brought a ton of these back from home and decided to brew them at work
                    inside of my thermos container. Because I didn't want to waste too much time, I didn't time the brewing or whatever, I just put the bag in and let it sit. As I type this, my cup is still filled with pipping hot tea water, and I can't wait to have it throughout the day.</p>

                    <p class="post-summary">Bought this months back and I've had it multiple times. But since my time was crunched, I haven't had the chance to actually have the tea yet, until now. Before, I've always made sure that I got pipping hot water in my thermos and drank it, because I found the rice teas did better just by sitting in the cup. So, obviously a good experience and is usually better than genmaicha tea, this tea's Japanese counterpart.</p>
