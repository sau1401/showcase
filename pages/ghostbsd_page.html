            <h2>What is a "BSD"?</h2>
            <h4>
                BSD, or Berkeley Software Distribution, is a now defunct operating system that was built on C and was a part of the Unix family (which would later offshot to modern-day Linux in the 90s). Many derivatives of this OS have popped up since its demise, including FreeBSD and OpenBSD, both of which are the "main" OSs that the remaining OSs are built off of.

            <h2>Why GhostBSD?</h2>
            <h4>
                Simple: it comes installed with <a href = "https://www.xfce.org"/>"xfce"</a>, which is a GUI that most BSD derivatives do not have to boot. FreeBSD alone is GUI-less and you are stuck with a shell prompt to start, compared to Linux. Which brings me to the reason why I'm NOT interested in Linux...
                
               <br> While I am interested in understanding OSs closer to the kernel, Linux is a derivative the tries to make things more "user-friendly" rather than embracing what made Unix, well, Unix. Not to mention the instability of entirely open-sourced projects (not to say open-sourced projects are entirely bad). That, and due to most programs not even supporting FreeBSD/Unix, I will be forced to find programs that work and get creative with the bootstrapping/package installing processes.

               <br> My goal isn't to make BSD more favorable or less favorable, it's just to experience firsthand something that is more restricted/locked down. You are welcome to see my progress in this tedious yet thrilling task.

            <h2>Getting it set up... on a ROG Strix G512LI</h2>
            <h4>
                It has been a geniune hassle to get GhostBSD booted up on my former gaming machine. Due to incompability issues (including the keyboard not working and driver errors), I've had to troubleshoot and debug for several days (starting on 01/18/2025). Hopefully, I can get this machine started and begin my BSD adventure.
